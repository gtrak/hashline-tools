I was following [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent) agent development, and intrigued by [oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi), but decided to start building on top of opencode instead.  
I am starting to regret that decision, but will see how far it goes.

I absolutely loved this blog post https://blog.can.ac/2026/02/12/the-harness-problem/ because I see failed edits constantly with Local LLMs, and this is a novel approach.  
Is it very novel though? BASIC had lines that start with indexes, too.  I want to use it, anyway. GOTO 200.

200 I am attempting to create a CLI version of this edit tool for later opencode integration, but it might stand alone. This was initially ported from opencode with LLM help.
